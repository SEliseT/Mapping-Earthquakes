# Mapping-Earthquakes

The goal of this project was to adequately map recent earthquakes.

I utilized the Leaflet library to create the Interactive Maps, and proceeded to use Mapbox API to gather base map styles. 

The earthquakes were then mapped and circle markers were placed to indicate each earthquake. A desription popup was linked to describe the location of each earthquake. Then, each earthquake was scaled and colored based on its magnitude. In addition to that, tectonic plates were mapped to offer greater insight on the location and magnitudes of the world's earthquakes. 

During the last step of the project, I used HTML to create an interactive webpage that allowed users to select certain background map styles and toggle the information.
